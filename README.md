# Spam-email-detection-by-machine-learning

**This project detects safe and harmful emails based on email body characteristics. For doing the task, I have used machine learning classifier algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, Ada Boost, Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB) etc. from the scikit-learn library. That made the detection of unsafe emails automatic. Hence, users will be free from the headache of the safety of their devices.** 

This model used classifiers from the scikit-learn library to build the models and used a dataset from Kaggle even though I preprocessed the dataset and removed noise from the dataset.
