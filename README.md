# Spam-email-detection-by-machine-learning

**This project detects safe and harmful emails based on email body characteristics. For doing the task, I have used machine learning algorithms like Random forest and other algorithms from the scikit-learn library. However, that made the detection of unsafe emails automatic, hence, users will be free from the headache of the safety of their devices.** 

This model used classifiers from the scikit-learn library to build the models and used a dataset from Kaggle even though I preprocessed the dataset and removed noise from the dataset.
